    "Abstract: We briefly review the main ideas of the *large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping* (LDDMM) algorithm.\n",

    "## Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this problem is to find how similar two images are. One way of doing this is to consider one of them as a **template** image, and the other as a **target** image, then one tries to find a transformation that maps the template into the target. If both images were exactly equal, this transformation would be the identity. Therefore, the norm of the difference of a nontrivial transformation to the identiy gives a measure of how similiar the images are.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several conditions that in practice are desirable. For instance, the transformation may not be a unique, and in such a case we want to select the simplest one, i.e. the closest to the identity. We want the transformation to be smooth and invertible, which guarantee that the images are topologically equivalent. Moreover, there might not be a perfect transformation between the images, thus we want the transformation which maps the template as close as possible to the target. \n",

    "## Image Registration Problem via LDDMM\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x \\in \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$. An *image* is the mapping $I: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $\\varphi: \\Omega \\to \\Omega$ be smooth, invertible, and differentiable, i.e. a *diffeomorphism*. The set of all transformations is denoted by $\\mbox{Diff}(\\Omega)$. Considering the product operation over this set as the composition between functions, $\\mbox{Diff}(\\Omega)$ is a group called *diffeormorphism group*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deforming the template image $I_0$ into the target image $I_1$ by the transformation $\\varphi$ corresponds to a change of coordinates, i.e.\n",

    "I_0(\\varphi^{-1}(x)) =  ( I_0 \\circ \\varphi^{-1} )(x) = I_1(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "thus $I_1 =  I_0 \\circ \\varphi^{-1}$ is the transformed image. Finding such a $\\varphi$ that transforms $I_0$ into $I_1$ is the *image resgistration problem*. Now if one introduces a squared distance\n",
    "$d^{2}_2(I_0\\circ\\varphi^{-1}, I_1)$ on the set of images, this measures how similar the transformed image $I_0\\circ\\varphi^{-1}$ is to the target image $I_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may happens that $\\varphi$ do not exist, or it is not unique. We can address this issue through a distance on the set of transformations $d_1^2(\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2)$, and impose that $\\varphi$ is close to the identity map $\\mbox{id}_{\\Omega}$.\n",

    "Notice that the first term $d_1$ takes care of the uniqueness problem and also selects the simplest transformation in the diffeomorphism group, while the second term $d_2$ allows us to find the closest transformation that maps $I_0$ into $I_1$ but which is not exactly equal to $I_1$. The constant $\\sigma$ controls the relative importance between both terms in the energy functional.\n",
