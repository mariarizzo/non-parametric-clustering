A Distribution-Free Approach to Clustering from Energy Statistics

Energy statistics provides a model-free hypothesis test for equality
of probability distributions. 
As sample size increases, the statistical potential energy 
is minimum under equality of distributions, and diverges otherwise.
Based on this hypothesis test, we consider the problem of clustering data
from an energy statistics perspective. Our mathematical formulation 
establishes an explicit connection to kernel methods, 
demonstrating that energy statistics based clustering 
is equivalent to a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) in the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We discuss spectral and iterative
methods to obtain local solutions of this QCQP. In particular,
we propose an algorithm based on Hartigan's method, having several
advantages over Lloyd's method, which kernel $k$-means is based on, specially
in high dimensions. Our numerical experiments illustrate this fact, and
furthermore, the model-free aspect of energy statistics by showing that the
proposed method is able to cluster data coming from very different distributions, 
outperforming $k$-means, Gaussian mixture models, and kernel $k$-means, 
in a variety of settings.
