- Kernel density estimation for each of the 3 algorithms in 1D
- Change colors in the graphs
- Give names to algorithms, 1D E-clustering, E-clustering, k-means, kernel
  k-means. Should we do E^{H}-clustering, E^{L}-clustering to distinguish
  Hartigan's and Lloyd's
- Fig 2a, GMM is doing to bad. Check, remove points with zero accuracy on the
  mean, also run GMM from sklearn to compare. Do this for every experiment.
- remove points with zero accuracy on means
- Fig. 4 too many lines in the plot. Show only E-H with different kernels.
  Maybe add a new plot showing the difference E-H - E-L for each kernel.
- Same for tables, show the difference.
